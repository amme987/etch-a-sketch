Grid squares change color to a random RGB value when the mouse passes over them, with the brightness getting darker with each pass until the square is black. The settings button allows the user to specify the number of squares per side for a new grid with a limit of 100 squares per side. Grid lines can be toggled on and off by clicking the checkbox.
